# 💧 Water Intake & Hydration Analyzer

A Python-based data visualization project that tracks and analyzes daily water intake vs recommended hydration levels. This project uses `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to turn simple health data into meaningful insights.
## 📁 Dataset

**Filename:** `water.csv`

**Sample Columns:**
- `Day`: Tracking day number
- `Person`: Name of the person
- `Age`: Age of the individual
- `WaterIntake (ml)`: Actual water consumed
- `Recommended (ml)`: Ideal water intake
- `HydrationStatus`: Categorized as `Low`, `Normal`, or `Overhydrated`
 ## 📊 Visualizations Included

- 📈 **Line Chart**: Actual vs Recommended water intake
- 📉 **Bar Chart**: Person-wise water consumption
- 🧠 *(More visualizations can be added like pie chart, boxplot, etc.)*

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the code
2. Make sure `water.csv` is in the same folder
3. Install dependencies (if not already):

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
#selfmade
